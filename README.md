# DBLayer
A database abstraction layer for the PHP language.

This project intends to be a simple way of implementing a database abstration layer for day to day applications. It focus on simplicity, avoiding extensive APIs that would take you some time to explore and work with.

It gives some extra funtionality with error management, as it gives you the option of throwing exceptions (with two different levels of information displaying) or using the return value of functions (usually FALSE when something has gone wrong) in order to build you own error management system.
